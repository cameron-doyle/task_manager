		- A meaningful error message is displayed when a form field is invalid.
		- The JavaScript code is in a separate file and the file is included in	the HTML page with no errors.

		Details are below:
		Implement a form that captures the fields required to create a task.

		Requirements:
		Create a JavaScript function called “validateTaskForm” that verifies
		that the inputs inserted by the user in the task form are correct:
		- Name -> Not Empty and longer than 8 characters
		- Description -> Not Empty and longer than 15 characters
		- AssignedTo -> Not Empty and longer than 8 characters
		- DueDate -> Not Empty and not less than current date */
